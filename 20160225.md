# Crystal Language

Today I built Crystal from the source repository using the version (0.12.0) supplied on my Arch machine. Crystal is self-hosted, meaning it is written in Crystal, so I needed to compile with itself. All I needed to do was run `make`.

Then I installed the icr project which supplies a REPL for Crystal. Multi-line expressions were not supported or threw an error, but single line expressions worked fine.

I worked through the "Syntax and Semantics" section of the language guide. Finished off on Array.

Interesting syntax notes:

- Characters are Int32 types that store a unicode codepoint.
- Different scales are supported for Ints and Floats (ex. `30i64`, `30i32`, `3.0f32`).
- Strings are immutable.
- Symbols are stored as Int32.

# Javascript

Today the goal was to start experiencing with ES2015 with the browser. I chose to start with gulp + babel although I probably could have just used HTML and JS from Chrome.

I followed the following resources to get gulp + babel "building" ES2015 javascript code:

- https://markgoodyear.com/2015/06/using-es6-with-gulp/
- http://techblog.constantcontact.com/software-development/use-es2015-with-babel-and-gulp/

I set up gulp + babel using:

```bash
npm install gulp babel-core babel-presets2015 gulp-babel --save-dev
touch .babelrc
echo "{ \"presets\": [\"es2015\"] }" >> .babelrc
touch gulpfile.babel.js
# 'use strict';
#
# import gulp from 'gulp';
# import babel from 'gulp-babel';
#
# gulp.task('build', function() {
#   return gulp.src('src/**/*.js')
#     .pipe(babel())
#     .pipe(gulp.dest('build'));
# });

gulp build 
```

Then I started looking at ES2015 walkthrough from the [Babel site](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

I started with the arrow syntax for anonymous function declaration. The following points were observed:

- Syntax is minimal: `item => *expression*` or `item => { *multiple statements* }`
- A `return` is needed when block syntax (i.e. `{ ... }`) is used.
- The `this` keyword is bound to the lexical scope around the anonymous function.

The following ES2015 was coded (from scratch, in vim):

```javascript
function isEven(number) {
  return number % 2 == 0;
}

console.log(isEven(1));
console.log(isEven(4));

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
console.log("Numbers: " + numbers);

var evenNumbers = numbers.map(n => n % 2 == 0);
console.log("Even numbers: " + evenNumbers);

var stringToAppend = "FooBarBaz";
var resultStrings  = ["one_", "two_", "three_"].map(
  i => {
    return i + stringToAppend
  }
);
console.log("Result strings (block): " + resultStrings);

var resultStrings  = ["one_", "two_", "three_"].map(
  i => i + stringToAppend
);
console.log("Result strings (inline): " + resultStrings);
```

Then I ran `gulp build` which produced the following ES5 code:

```javascript
"use strict";

function isEven(number) {
  return number % 2 == 0;
}

console.log(isEven(1));
console.log(isEven(4));

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
console.log("Numbers: " + numbers);

var evenNumbers = numbers.map(function (n) {
  return n % 2 == 0;
});
console.log("Even numbers: " + evenNumbers);

var stringToAppend = "FooBarBaz";
var resultStrings = ["one_", "two_", "three_"].map(function (i) {
  return i + stringToAppend;
});
console.log("Result strings (block): " + resultStrings);

var resultStrings = ["one_", "two_", "three_"].map(function (i) {
  return i + stringToAppend;
});
console.log("Result strings (inline): " + resultStrings);
```
